  <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Lorem
  Ipsum</strong>&nbsp;is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
  industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
  the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
  make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
  the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
  popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
  Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
  PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><h2>Why do we use it?</h2><p
  class="ql-align-justify">It is a long established fact that a reader will be
  distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The
  point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
  of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
  like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
  now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
  ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
  have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
  (injected humour and the like).</p><p><br></p><h2>Where does it come
  from?</h2><p class="ql-align-justify">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum
  is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
  literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
  Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
  more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
  through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
  undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
  Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written
  in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
  the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
  amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p><h2>What is Lorem
